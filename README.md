Write a Java application that allows users to choose the searching or sorting algorithm type and request the list of items to search or sort.
•Compute the running time of the algorithms (theoretical or empirical analysis approach)
Determine the time complexity of your algorithm, searching and sorting algorithms.
•Display the search value or the sorted list to the user.
Note: the application should take the list to search or sort at running time, not compile time.
[You are submitting the Java code and the computed running time/time complexity of the algorithms]
